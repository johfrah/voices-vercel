Choosing my voice means being able to clearly communicate the message that embodies your business! You may want your client to get excited, convince, trust, prefer you for all these possibilities together. Well, if you are looking for a voice that can captivate your potential client in a few moments, you have found the perfect voice for you!

I have been an Italian native voice talent for over 20 years, I have great experience in communication having worked for a long time in radio as a presenter and journalist. I work independently thanks to my home studio where I record every day for my clients. I am fast, precise and passionate about my work. I can autonomously manage advertising scripts, corporate scripts, narratives and audiobooks.
