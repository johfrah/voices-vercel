My warm and friendly personality combined with efficiency and attention to detail have helped me consolidate my global VO career in Europe and beyond. My voice is deep and warm with a gravitas that makes people take turn with interest to hear what I am saying.

The son of Indian parents, I grew up in the Canary Islands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. My career as a voice over artist spans over 20 years, a large component of which is public speaking. My work experience ranges from investment banking at Goldman Sachs to NGO’s - thanks to his multi-cultural diversity, I am able to create the right persona sounding convincing and real, in English, Spanish or French.
