Hi, I am Sue and I’m native German and a professional voice over artist and singer. I have already spoken and sung for German TV-stations, web commercials, explainer videos and everything else you can imagine. I'm based in Berlin, Germany, but my clients hire me from around the world.
I mostly record authentic commercials, corporate videos and – of course IVR messages.
Long time before I started as a voice over I worked as voice director and sounddesigner. Als I was singer in band. So I combined my knowledge of how to sound with my voice with the experience of the voice director who knows what he wants to hear and started as voice artist. 
I love to speak IVR as I come to get to know companies that I wouldn’t have found before. It’s so interesting which companies exist where and do what. I always google them when I get a booking, just because I am so curious.

Something you didn’t know about me: I was on stage as background singer and musician with some well-known European music stars.
