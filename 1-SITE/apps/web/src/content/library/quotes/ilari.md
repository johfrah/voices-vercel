Born and raised ‘below the rivers’ and above Belgium, I was always surrounded by different languages and dialects. A Finnish mom, a Danish friend, a peer-group with a heavy, local accent and a good set of ears helped me along. I travelled the world and the seven seas to finally start a wonderful career in voice overs. Clients tend to choose me, when looking for a trustworthy sound. Upon request with a twist for sure! In my looooong career, I have narrated many IVR systems and voicemails (called answering machines in the 80s).
