Willy is curious and imaginative, he helps companies to create value by producing audio and video content, especially as a voice-over artist. He believes that content creation is a tool to express things in our own way. If he can produce content to help people express their ideas more effectively, he can help them communicate better and solve their problems. With a passion for productivity and personal development tools, he is the author of the blog and podcast ”Ma Vie En Mieux"(My Life Gets Better), and the "Time Master" training course in which he guides new freelancers towards a better version of themselves through coaching.
