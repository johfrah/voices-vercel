I am a passionate singer, music player, with a high sensitivity to sound - in its widest definition (no pun intended). Very young, I had the opportunity to record in a studio setting and I loved every minute of it: the teamwork with other sound/music professionals, the very special atmosphere of recording studios, etc, all made me very happy. Yet, my natural inclination for that career was hindered by the duty to pursue the family projects in the corporate world, and I set my passion aside. I developed my sense of musicality through the learning of various foreign languages, by imitating the melody of the accents. Today, I am grateful to be able to put together all the pieces of the puzzle by offering voice work in different languages.
