Im a professional actor, I have played over 70 theatre plays in Germany and Luxembourg.
Since 1995 I'm also doing voice over acting, also with dubbing. Then also came commercials and station ids.
Now I have the biggest Radiostation in Europe- Radio NRW with 46 stations and some others too.

We- my family with 2 of three kids- live in Berlin and we have chickens and bees.
