I am a truly international voice talent - I live in the US, my family is from Ireland (I work in most native English dialects, including neutral), I've been to over 50 countries, and I speak Spanish, as I used to live in Ecuador. I also lived in Mali: I ni ce. I ka kene wa? ("Hello! How are you?" in Bambara) 
I’ve been an improviser and actress since I was 11, which has helped me build a rewarding voice over career over the past three decades. I specialize in commercial, narration and animation - especially android/AI/computer/GPS voices. Highlights include TV campaigns for Subaru, United Health and H&R Block; voicing Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow for the Iron Man video game; and Siri, in Ellen's iPhone, on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. 
I'm a certified Death Midwife (assisting in End-of-Life and green burial), and I teach Adaptive yoga to seniors and the disabled population.
