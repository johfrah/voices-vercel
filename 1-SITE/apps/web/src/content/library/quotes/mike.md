Mike is a British voice talent who swapped big city life in London for the log cabin life in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, USA.
A disruptive inﬂuence in school, Mike's ﬁrst break in narration came at age six, when his teacher realised he could tell the afternoon story better than her (and she could get a nap by way of a bonus!)
When he's not in his home studio, you'll ﬁnd him enjoying hobby farm life and tending to two charming pet goats, named Baxter and Hazel, an adorable mini horse called Annie, and a hornless unicorn named Melodie…
