I am good at receiving directions, I am fast and incredibly efficient. I love voice-over because I believe in the seductive, instructive power of the human voice.
I am a confident performer and public speaker, my voice is the channel through which I convey what is important to me.
I am playful, energetic and always with a smile on my face (unless you want me to be angry, sad and a downer, I can certainly voice these emotions too).
I have been working as a voice-over artist for 3 years now, and I am signed by 8 different agencies, all over the world! 

I love people, I believe in kindness and my work is a direct mirror of who I am inside!
