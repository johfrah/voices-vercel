Having been a showgirl (yes seriously), a TV weather presenter and a breakfast radio show host … I’ve finally found what I really love, and that is being a voiceover. I love that I can live in rural England, half way up the Pennines, and still work for clients all around the world. I first voiced a commercial in 1993 and I built my own studio at home in 2011! One of the best things about voicing is that you work on so many different projects, I’ve voiced dolls, guided people around very complex interactive phone systems, given instructions on a television and so much more. But the work I’m most proud of is the more than 60,000 announcements I’ve recorded for Transport for London. Since 2006 I’ve been heard on all of London’s buses, and I’m now also heard on the Overground Trains, Riverbus and will be the voice of announcements for the new Elizabeth Line.
