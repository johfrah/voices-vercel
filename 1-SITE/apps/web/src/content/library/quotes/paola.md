I'm an Italian professional dubber, dubbing director, voice talent with recording studio. I have more than 10 years of experience in this field.
I record for many types of projects: dubbings, voice overs, documentaries, audiobooks, commercials, e-learnings etc etc..

I’m from Milan but I’ve been living in Padova for almost 20 years now. My accent is neutral Italian. My voice is "Young-medium / medium”.

I’m also a singer! I’ve been singing since I was very young and now I’m specialized in recording songs for kids :)
